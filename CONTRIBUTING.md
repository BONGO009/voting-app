# Contribution Guidelines
Voting App was built for our internal needs at DoSomething.org, but feel free to poke around the codebase and see how we implemented things.

## Code Guidelines
Make sure you have [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) set up to use this project's indentation settings. In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
